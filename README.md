# DEVELOPING-CUSTOM-CNN-MODEL-FOR-MULTILABEL-CLASSIFICATION-FOR-COVID-NORMAL-PNEUMONIA-DATASET-
This is a custom CNN model to classify images whether they are covid,normal or pneumonia lungs. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using tensorflow
